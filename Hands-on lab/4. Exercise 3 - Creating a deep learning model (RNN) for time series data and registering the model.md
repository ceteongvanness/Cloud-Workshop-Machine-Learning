## Exercise 3: Creating a deep learning model (RNN) for time series data

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a deep learning model (using a RNN - Recurrent Neural Network), and you will apply the forecast model to a Spark streaming job in order to make predictions against streaming data.

#### Task 1: Create the deep learning model and start a streaming job using a notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Databricks Workspace and navigate to `AI with Databricks and AML \ 3.0 Deep Learning with Time Series`. This is the notebook you will step through executing in this exercise.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the exercise.
