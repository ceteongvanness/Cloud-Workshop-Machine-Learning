## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 5 minutes

To avoid unexpected charges, it is recommended that you clean up all of your lab resources when you complete the lab.

#### Task 1: Clean up lab resources

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the `MCW-Machine-Learning` Resources Group created for this lab.
2. Select **Delete resource group** from the command bar.

3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete**.
4. Wait for the confirmation that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted. If you don't wait, and the delete fails for some reason, you may be left with resources running that were not expected. You can monitor using the Notifications dialog, which is accessible from the Alarm icon.
