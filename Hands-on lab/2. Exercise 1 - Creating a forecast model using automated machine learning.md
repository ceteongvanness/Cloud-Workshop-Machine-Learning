## Exercise 1: Data exploration and preprocessing

Duration: 40 minutes

Understanding data through data exploration is one of the core challenges faced today by data engineers and data scientists. Using raw data for modeling can produce misleading results, since data is often noisy and unreliable, and may be missing values. In this exercise, you will explore the raw data, transform and register the dataset in the Datastore. You will use it to train a forecasting model later in this hands-on-lab. The data preparation steps will be performed on the Azure Databricks cluster.

#### Task 1: Load, explore and prepare the dataset using an Azure Databricks notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Databricks Workspace and navigate to `AI with Databricks and AML \ 1.0 Data Preparation`. This is the notebook you will step through executing in this exercise.
2. When you execute a notebook, you will need to attach it to a cluster. You can specify that the **lab** cluster should be used in the upper left-hand corner of the notebook.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the exercise. Press Shift+Enter to execute a cell.
