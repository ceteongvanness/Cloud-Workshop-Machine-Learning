## Machine Learning before the hands-on lab setup guide

### Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.
   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability  to deploy multiple resource groups.

### Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

#### Task 2: Create an Azure Databricks cluster

You have provisioned an Azure Databricks workspace, and now you need to create a news cluster within the workspace.

1. From the side menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**, then enter your resource group name (e.g., `MCW-AI-Lab`) into the filter box, and select it from the list.

2. Next, select your Azure Databricks service from the list.

3. In the Overview pane of the Azure Databricks service, **Launch Workspace**.

   Azure Databricks will automatically log you in using Azure Active Directory Single Sign On.

4. Select **Clusters** (1) from the menu, then select **Create Cluster** (2).

5. On the Create New Cluster form, provide the following:

   - **Cluster Name**: lab
   - **Cluster Mode**: Standard
   - **Databricks Runtime Version**: Runtime: 5.5 LTS ML (Scala 2.11, Spark 2.4.3)
   - **Python Version**: 3
   - **Enable autoscaling**: Uncheck this option
   - **Auto Termination**: Leave checked and in the text box enter `120`.
   - **Worker Type**: Standard_DS3_v2
   - **Driver Type**: Same as worker
   - **Workers**: 1

6.  Select **Create Cluster**

#### Task 3: Install libraries on the Azure Databricks Cluster

The notebooks you will run depends on certain Python libraries that will need to be installed in your cluster. The following steps walk you thru adding these dependencies.

1. From the left-hand menu in your Workspace, select **Clusters**.
2. In the list of clusters, select your cluster.
3. Select the **Libraries** link and then select **Attach New**.
4. In the Library Source, select **PyPi** and in the Package text box type `azureml-sdk[automl_databricks, explain]` and select **Install**.
5. An entry for azureml-sdk will appear in the list with a status of installing followed by installed.

#### Task 4: Upload the Databricks notebook archive

1. Within the Azure Databricks Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select Workspace, Users and select your username (the entry with house icon).
2. In the blade that appears, select the downwards pointing chevron next to your name, and select Import.
3. On the Import Notebooks dialog, select URL and paste in the following URL:
   `https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/notebooks/AI%20with%20Databricks%20and%20AML.dbc?raw=true`
4. Select **Import**
5. A folder named after the archive should appear. Select that folder.
6. The folder will contain one or more notebooks. These are the notebooks you will use in the completing this lab.

#### Task 5: Create your Azure Machine Learning Workspace

1. In the Azure Portal, select **+ Create a resource**, then type `Azure Machine Learning` into the search bar. Select `Machine Learning service workspaces` from the results.
2. Select **Create** on the blade that follows.
3. In the Create Machine Learning Workspace dialog that appears, provide the following values:
   - **Workspace Name**: AML-workspace
   - **Subscription**: Choose your Azure subscription
   - **Resource Group**: Select the resource group in which you deployed your Azure Databricks workspace.
   - **Location**: Choose a region closest to you (it is OK if the Azure Databricks Workspace and the Azure Machine Learning Worksapce are in different locations).
4. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create** on the dialog that appears.

You should follow all this steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
