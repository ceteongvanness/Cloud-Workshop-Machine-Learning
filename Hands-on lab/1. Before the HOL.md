## Machine Learning before the hands-on lab setup guide

### Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN
   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.
   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability  to deploy multiple resource groups.

### Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

#### Task 1: Create your Azure Databricks Account

Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for Azure that supports data engineering and machine learning and deep learning workloads.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+ Create a resource**, then type "Azure Databricks" into the seach bar. Select Azure Databricks from the results.

2. Select **Create** on the bottom of the blade that follows.
3. Set the following configuration on the Azure Databricks Service creation forms:
   - **Workspace name** : Enter a unique name as indicated by a green checkmark.
   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource Group**: Select **Create new** and provide the name `MCW-Machine-Learning`
   - **Region**: Select a region close to you. ***(If you are using Azure Pass, select South Central US.)***
   - **Pricing**: Select Premium

4. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create** when the form values passes validation.

#### Task 2: Create an Azure Databricks cluster

You have provisioned an Azure Databricks workspace, and now you need to create a new cluster within the workspace.

1. From within Azure portal navigate to your resource group name (e.g., `MCW-Machine-Learning`).

2. Next, select your Azure Databricks service from the list.

3. In the Overview pane of the Azure Databricks service, **Launch Workspace**.

   ![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Cloud-Workshop-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/images/T1-5.png)

   Azure Databricks will automatically log you in using Azure Active Directory Single Sign On.

4. Select **Clusters** (1) from the menu, then select **Create Cluster** (2).

   ![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Cloud-Workshop-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/images/T1-7.png)

5. On the Create New Cluster form, provide the following:

   - **Cluster Name**: `lab`
   - **Cluster Mode**: **Standard**
   - **Databricks Runtime Version**: **Runtime: 7.3 LTS (Scala 2.12, Spark 3.0.1)**
   - **Enable autoscaling**: **Uncheck** this option.
   - **Terminate after ___ minutes of inactivity**: Leave **checked** and in the text box enter `120`.
   - **Worker Type**: **Standard_DS3_v2**
   - **Workers**: `1`
   - **Driver Type**: **Same as worker**

#### Task 3: Install libraries on the Azure Databricks Cluster

The notebooks you will run depends on certain Python libraries that will need to be installed in your cluster. The following steps walk you through adding these dependencies.

1. From the left-hand menu in your Workspace, select **Clusters**.

   ![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Cloud-Workshop-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/images/T1-10.png)

2. In the list of clusters, select your cluster. Make sure the state of the cluster is `Running`.
   ![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Cloud-Workshop-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/images/T1-11.png)

3. Select the **Libraries** link and then select **Install New**.

   ![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Cloud-Workshop-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/images/T1-12.png)

4. In the Library Source, select **PyPi** and in the Package text box type `azureml-sdk[databricks]` and select **Install**.

   ![](https://github.com/ceteongvanness/Cloud-Workshop-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Hands-on%20lab/images/T1-13.png)

5. An entry for azureml-sdk will appear in the list. The install will progress first with a status of installing followed by the status of installed.

#### Task 4: Upload the Databricks notebook archive

1. Within the Azure Databricks Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select Workspace, Users and select your username (the entry with house icon).

2. In the blade that appears, select the downwards pointing chevron next to your name, and select **Import**.

3. On the Import Notebooks dialog, select **URL** and paste in the following URL:

   `https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/notebooks/AI%20with%20Databricks%20and%20AML.dbc?raw=true`

4. Select **Import**

   > **Note**: If you are facing difficulty with this URL, you can also consider cloning this repository locally, and uploading the file from your computer to databricks. To do this, download the zip archive of this repository, and extract it to a known location. Then, from the repository root, navigate to `Hands-on lab/notebooks/AI with Databricks and AML.dbc`.
   >

5. A folder named after the archive should appear. Select that folder.

6. The folder will contain one or more notebooks. These are the notebooks you will use in the completing this lab.

#### Task 5: Create your Azure Machine Learning Workspace

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **+ Create a resource**, then type `Machine Learning` into the search bar.

3. In the Create Machine Learning Workspace dialog that appears, provide the following values:
   - **Workspace Name**: `mcwmachinelearning`
   - **Subscription**: Choose your Azure subscription.
   - **Resource group**: Select the resource group in which you deployed your Azure Databricks workspace.
   - **Location**: Choose a region closest to you (it is OK if the Azure Databricks Workspace and the Azure Machine Learning Workspace are in different locations).
   - **Workspace edition**: Select `Enterprise`.
   
     > If did not showing **Workspace edition**, please ignore it.
